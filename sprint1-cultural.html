    <title>Begining of new journey</title>
    <h1>Identity, Values and Strengths</h1> 

    <p>I will start here with the difficult moral chice that I had to make one day. To get to the point I have to describe the situation I was in. 
        In 2015 I finished my 2 months long Topdeck training tour which every crew member has to go through. After that I was assigned to do my first real tour with more experieced crew. The driver that I got was realy nice
        and friendly guy. We had a great time together. As a shadow driver to boost my skills I got to drive the coach for most of the time, meaning that the other driver would just sit behind me and supervise. At the end
        of this tour in Amsterdam he went partying with passengers till late. Next morning we had to get up at 5:30am and pick up the coach from the parking located about 30 minutes away. Unfortunately my colegue wasn't able 
        to get up on time. Unluckily for him there were other crew members from other tours that saw him staying in the pub till 2am. When we came back to our base and went for debriefing transport manager asked him aout the whole situation.
        He told him his own storry about it which wasn't the truth. Next he asked me to confirm and that was the decision that I had to make within seconds. Either confirm his storryline and save his job or tell the truth and
        get him dismissed. Throughout entire tour I disaproved his behaviour, but to be fair he was never even trying to drive after big nights out. I was driving he was partying which should not be the case but after all 
        he never put anyone in danger. That was the crucial factor that affected my decision to back up his storry and save his job. I think he learned his lesson and didn't do that again.
    </p>
    <p></p>>
    <p>I think one of my strong things is problem solving approach. In everyday life I am trying to do as much as I can on my own like DIY, fixing bikes and cars, building computers. I really like to solve problems not only my own ones but helping other people is something that I enjoy doing. In most of my previous employments
         that was the key to success. I also see myself as positive person that doesn’t worry and panic about things, I rather find the solution than get stuck in panic mode. When I work with other people even if I
          disagree, I try to see things from their perspective, it helps a lot in understanding your co-workers and Long-term goal and or career pathway more effective work in the future. My biggest limitations are
          in my mind. Sometimes I am stubborn and trying to force something that isn’t best solution.</p>
          <p>My family, friends and feedback from my passengers (used to be Topdeck coach driver on European Tours) give me some idea how others my percive me. 
              Most of the people see me as friendly, helpful person that is fun to be with. My wife said that she really value kindnes towards the others. I think that's coming from my mother who is always kind to 
            other people and living with her day to day injected some of her values to my life. Culturaly I was raised in Poland and I do identify myself with some of the values of my Polish enviroment. 
        In short way I can describe polish people as hard working, friendly, family and friends orientated with strong patriotic identity. Unfortunately there are some flaws too. Polish people are not very 
        open and sometimes negative. A lot of these values come from our war-rich history and might be hard to understand by others.  </p>

    <h2>Personality type: Protagonist</h2>
       <div> <p class="blocktext"> 
        
<h3>Protagonist Strengths</h3>

<h4>Tolerant</h4><p>Protagonists are true team players, and they recognize that that means listening to other peoples’ opinions, even when they contradict their own. They admit they don’t have all the answers, and are often receptive to dissent, so long as it remains constructive.</p>
<h4>Reliable</h4> <p>The one thing that galls Protagonists the most is the idea of letting down a person or cause they believe in. If it’s possible, Protagonists can always be counted on to see it through.</p>
<h4>Charismatic</h4><p> Charm and popularity are qualities Protagonists have in spades. They instinctively know how to capture an audience, and pick up on mood and motivation in ways that allow them to communicate with reason, emotion, passion, restraint – whatever the situation calls for. Talented imitators, Protagonists are able to shift their tone and manner to reflect the needs of the audience, while still maintaining their own voice.</p>
<h4>Altruistic</h4> <p>Uniting these qualities is Protagonists’ unyielding desire to do good in and for their communities, be it in their own home or the global stage. Warm and selfless, Protagonists genuinely believe that if they can just bring people together, they can do a world of good.</p>
<h4>Natural Leaders</h4><p> More than seeking authority themselves, Protagonists often end up in leadership roles at the request of others, cheered on by the many admirers of their strong personality and positive vision.</p>
<h3>Protagonist weaknesses</h3>
<h4>Overly Idealistic</h4> <p>People with the Protagonist personality type can be caught off guard as they find that, through circumstance or nature, or simple misunderstanding, people fight against them and defy the principles they’ve adopted, however well-intentioned they may be. They are more likely to feel pity for this opposition than anger, and can earn a reputation of naïveté.</p>
<h4>Too Selfless</h4> <p>Protagonists can bury themselves in their hopeful promises, feeling others’ problems as their own and striving hard to meet their word. If they aren’t careful, they can spread themselves too thin, and be left unable to help anyone.</p>
<h4>Too Sensitive</h4> <p>While receptive to criticism, seeing it as a tool for leading a better team, it’s easy for Protagonists to take it a little too much to heart. Their sensitivity to others means that Protagonists sometimes feel problems that aren’t their own and try to fix things they can’t fix, worrying if they are doing enough.</p>
<h4>Fluctuating Self-Esteem</h4> <p>Protagonists define their self-esteem by whether they are able to live up to their ideals, and sometimes ask for criticism more out of insecurity than out of confidence, always wondering what they could do better. If they fail to meet a goal or to help someone they said they’d help, their self-confidence will undoubtedly plummet.</p>
<h4>Struggle to Make Tough Decisions</h4><p> If caught between a rock and a hard place, Protagonists can be stricken with paralysis, imagining all the consequences of their actions, especially if those consequences are humanitarian.
